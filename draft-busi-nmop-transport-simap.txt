Abstract

   This document explores the applicability of the Service &
   Infrastructure Maps (SIMAP) concepts to transport networks and it
   examines the YANG data models defined by the IETF to support the
   requirements and use cases for SIMAP applicability to transport
   networks.

1.  Introduction

   The concept of Service & Infrastructure Maps (SIMAP) is being defined
   in [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept] together with a set of SIMP
   requirements and use cases.

   A transport network is a server-layer network designed to provide
   connectivity services for a client-layer network to carry the client
   traffic transparently across the server-layer network resources.

   A transport network typically utilizes several different transport
   technologies such as the Optical Transport Networks (OTN) or
   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM).

   The concept of SIMAP applies to any type of networks, including but
   not being limited to transport networks.

   This document complements the definitions in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept] providing specific requirements and use
   cases for SIMAP applicability to transport networks.

   It also examines the YANG data models defined by the IETF to support
   these specific requirements and use cases at the northbound interface
   of an optical network controller.
