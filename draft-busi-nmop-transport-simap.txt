1.  Introduction

   The concept of Service & Infrastructure Maps (SIMAP) is being defined
   in [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept] together with a set of SIMP
   requirements and use cases.

   A transport network is a server-layer network designed to provide
   connectivity services for a client-layer network to carry the client
   traffic transparently across the server-layer network resources.

   A transport network typically utilizes several different transport
   technologies such as the Optical Transport Networks (OTN) or
   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM).

   The concept of SIMAP applies to any type of networks, including but
   not being limited to transport networks.

   This document complements the definitions in
   [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept] providing specific requirements and use
   cases for SIMAP applicability to transport networks.

   It also examines the YANG data models defined by the IETF to support
   these specific requirements and use cases at the northbound interface
   of an optical network controller.

1.1.  Terminology

   The following terms are defined in [I-D.ietf-nmop-simap-concept] and
   are not redefined here:

   *  Service & Infrastructure Maps (SIMAP)

   The following terms are defined in [rfc9543] and are not redefined
   here:

   *  Service Level Agreement (SLA)

      Editors' Note: should we differentiate between SLA, SLO, SLE and
      SLI within this I-D?

2.  Overview of Key Requirements for Transport SIMAP

   TODO Overview of Key Requirements for Transport SIMAP

2.2.  Delay Measurement

2.3.  Availability

2.4.  Real-time Evaluation (Risk?)

3.  Use Cases

3.1.  Service Provisioning

   A transport network provides connectivity services to carry the
   client traffic transparently.

   In order to allow monetization of the transport network connectivity
   services, transport networks are evolving to support connectivity
   services with differentiated SLAs.

   Transport networks can support connectivity services with different
   requirements in terms of bandwidth, delay and availability, or any
   combination of them.  For examples, some services may have different
   bandwidth requirements (e.g., 10G, 100G) or different delay
   requirements or different availability requirements.  Other services
   can have both bandwidth and delay requirements or both delay and
   availability requirements.

   An optical network controller is able to receive connectivity service
   requests with constraints in terms of bandwidth or delay or
   availability or any combination of them.

   A transport network typically utilizes several different transport
   technologies such as the Optical Transport Networks (OTN) or
   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM).  Therefore the request to
   setup a new connectivity service would trigger multi-layer path
   computation and setup e.g. to determine whether:

   1.  an OTN tunnel already exists within the transport network to
       carry the new requested connectivity service while meeting the
       requested bandwidth, delay and availability requirements: in this
       case the optical network controller just configures the
       connectivity service on the two devices at the edge of the
       selected OTN tunnel;

   2.  a new OTN tunnel needs to be setup with the transport network and
       whether the path of this new OTN tunnel:

       a.  can re-use existing links or server-layer WDM tunnels: in
           this case the optical network controller starts the OTN
           tunnel setup procedure (e.g., through GMPLS signalling) and
           then configures the connectivity service on the two devices
           at the edge of the just set up OTN tunnel;

       b.  requires the setup of one ore more new WDM tunnels within the
           transport network: in this case the optical network
           controller:

           i.    starts the WDM tunnel setup procedure (e.g., through
                 GMPLS signalling) for all the new WDM tunnels which
                 need to be setup;

           ii.   start the OTN tunnel setup procedure (e.g., through
                 GMPLS signalling);

           iii.  configures the connectivity service on the two devices
                 at the edge of the just set up OTN tunnel.

      Add some description about the top-down approach and multi-layer
      path computation/setup performed by optical controller

      Describe why the optical controller needs to get the complete view
      of the optical resources (including the pluggable modules)
      although this might be controversial

      Discuss about co-cabling and cotranching capability of the optical
      controller to improve the service provisioning with availability
      SLA

3.2.  Alarm and Incident

3.3.  Risk Prediction

      Related with protection and restoration.  Current approach is
      based on the monitoring of the status of the connection (SF or SD)
      triggering re-routing.  SF is mainly related to loss of
      continuity.  What about latency degradation?

      Provide more enhanced SD definitions (latency)

      Need to notify the status of the protection/restoration after a
      failure occurs.  The customer may request to reconfigure the
      service availability (e.g., from 1+1 to always-1+1) or do nothing.

      More discussion to be done based on the availability monetization
      description
